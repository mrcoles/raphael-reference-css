Raphael Reference Page CSS
==========================

**NOTE: this is no longer useful, since the docs page on the Raphael site has been changed to have the navigation in a fixed scrollable position. However, it can still be used as a super simple template for a user script.**

This Chrome User Script makes the [Raphael.js Reference page](http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html) easier to use by applying some CSS to give the navigation a fixed scrollable position on the right side of the page.

Just drag the raphael-reference-css.user.js file over Google Chrome and it will ask you if you want to install the script and once youâ€™re done it will automatically apply itself to *just* that reference page.
